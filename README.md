# Maze Exploration and Line Following Robot Adventure 🤖🔍🌟

Embark on a captivating robotic exploration mission with our Maze Exploration and Line Following project. Developed as part of the Control Digital Systems Course at Amirkabir University of Tehran, this project challenges us to design a robot that not only navigates and explores a complex maze but also detects and follows lines within the maze environment. The ultimate goal is to uncover all lines and  traverse back to the starting point. 🚀🔮🎯

## Project Details 🌟

- Robot: e-Puck robot equipped with motor encoders, ground sensors, and distance sensors.
- Controllers: Utilized PID controllers for base movements and line following.
- DFS strategy for maze exploration.

## Key Objectives 🎯

- Explore the maze and uncover all lines using PID control and advanced sensors.
- Implement digital control methods and discretization for precise navigation.
- Construct a tree graph of paths based on line coordinates for detailed mapping.

## Mission Tasks 🛠️

- Utilize PID controllers for base movements and accurate line following with the e-Puck robot.
- Address challenges with digital control methods and discretization techniques.
- Follow a strategic exploration plan to uncover all lines and navigate back to the starting point.

## Innovations and Challenges ❗️ ❗️

1. Real-Time System (RTS) Mastery:

- Tackling synchronization issues in running functions and resource management.
- Solution: Delving into flag manipulation and access permissions for seamless synchronization.

2. Speed Optimization Dilemmas:

- Addressing delays in flag writing processes affecting system efficiency.
- Solution: Rethinking flag update strategies to align with code execution delays for enhanced system speed.

3. Probblems with run time of ground sensors reading:

- The function which has responsibility to change the flag when ever it detects line, has more frequency than the main controller so it will intrupt in flag value after exiting the line.
- Solution: change the flag first and then finish all actions needed so we will be sure that the flag has been changed correctly whenever it's needed to get checked.

## Improvements 📈

- Line Detection Precision:
- Facing the challenge of accurate line detection for seamless path tracking.
- Strategy: Implement robust algorithms and sensor calibration techniques for enhanced line-following accuracy.
- Efficient Exploration:
- Ensuring efficient maze exploration and line detection capabilities.
- Strategy: Optimize robot movements and DFS priorities, decision-making processes, and path traversal algorithms for swift and effective exploration.
